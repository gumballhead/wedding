                <h4>Andrew and Tena are getting married!</h4>

                <p>
                    We are doing a destination wedding in Playa del Carmen, Mexico.
                    This will just be a really fun vacation with our closest people, with a wedding ceremony on the beach.
                    We'll be there from <b>Tuesday, February 1st</b> to <b>Monday, February 7th</b>, with events planned throughout the week.
                    We hope to see you there and invite you to participate in as much as you want or are able to. This is your vacation too!
                </p>

                <h4>Getting there</h4>

                <p>
                    The wedding will be held at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g150812-d530483-Reviews-Hilton_Playa_del_Carmen-Playa_del_Carmen_Yucatan_Peninsula.html">Hilton Playa del Carmen</a>, an all-inclusive, adults-only resort.
                    If you are travelling with minors, there are other family-friendly resorts close by. I would look close to the 5th Avenue area on the beach.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Guests who are staying at another resort will have access to the Hilton during the wedding ceremony.
                    The Hilton does not provide or sell wristbands to non-guests outside of the ceremony, but
                    Playa del Carmen is a very safe area and there are plenty of things around to do so we won't be isolated at separate resorts the whole week.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You can book a package deal that includes flights on <a href="https://www.expedia.com">expedia.com</a>.
                    This is normally the cheapest way to book your trip. Flight prices are highly variable, so we use <a href="https://flights.google.com">Google Flights</a>
                    and <a href="https://support.google.com/travel/answer/6235879">set up a flight tracker</a> to get notifications when prices drop.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're coming from Des Moines, you can usually save yourself a good $500 or so by leaving from Minneapolis or Kansas City. Minneapolis will even go direct to Cancun.
                    There are <a href="https://www.bloomingtonmn.org/bloomington-stay-and-fly">stay and fly hotels</a> in Minneapolis that will let you park for free the whole week and
                    also provide a free shuttle to the airport.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Once you arrive in Cancun, you'll need to get transportation to Playa del Carmen, which is about 45 minutes away.
                    If you booked through Expedia, they should contact you to arrange a shuttle in the weeks before your trip.
                    They'll be walking around wearing Expedia jackets outside the airport, so they're easy to find.
                    Otherwise, there are taxis available outside the airport.
                    You'll probably also want to book your return flight in the afternoon to give yourself plenty of time to get back to the airport.
                </p>
